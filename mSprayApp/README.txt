# mSpray Application

This is the folder for the MSpray project's mobile app, the
application for storing data from pesticide sprayings in Limpopo,
South Africa.

Building the app is easiest with Eclipse - the eclipse project in this
folder can be imported through eclipse, and built from there. After
that, it will be ready to be deployed onto phones by plugging them
into the computer, and entering "debug mode" for this app with those
phones. This can be done by importing the project, and then clicking the play button from any of the Java files in the application.

One could also copy the .apk file in the directory labeled "bin" onto
a phone, and install the application from there.

The Google Spreadsheet library was extremely helpful in making this
program possible - their JAR files were included in the "lib" folder
of this project, and were instrumental in the uploading of data onto
the Google Spreadsheet of all of the mSpray 2.0 data.
