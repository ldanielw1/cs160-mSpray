This is the folder for the MSpray project's mobile app.

Building the app is easiest with Eclipse - the eclipse project in this
folder can be imported through eclipse, and built from there. After
that, it will be ready to be deployed onto phones by plugging them
into the computer, and entering "debug mode" for this app with those
phones.

One could also copy the .apk file in the directory labeled "bin" onto
a phone, and install the application from there.
